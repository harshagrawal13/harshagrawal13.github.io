Recently me **(a.k.a Harsh**) and my project partner **Anmol** were awarded the [Pradhan Mantri Bal Shakti Puraskar 2020](http://nca-wcd.nic.in/) in the field of innovation for our project on **_‘Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer’_**

This year it was conferred to **49 children** between the age group of 5-18 years under various categories including bravery, social service, sports, art and culture, innovation and scholastic. A cash award of 1 Lakh, a tablet, and a medal was presented to each awardee.  

It was a six-day event from **21st January to 26th January 2020**. It was a hell-of-a-blast! And I know I'm nearly 10 days late for writing this blog but its not my fault (actually, it is) - high resolution weren't uploaded yet! (What a lame excuse Harsh...). Anyways, I finally decided to pour out my heart (**_metaphorically!_**). So here it begins!

## Day One: 'Where it all began' - 21st January 2020 ##

We arrived at the Hotel Ashok, the place of stay, on 21st. The hotel was awesome but more flabbergasting was the vibe as I would be spending a week with 49 amazing people. We checked in, rested for somewhile and then reported for briefing and collecting our tailored blazers (It looked awesome on me... Oh who am I kidding). Anyways I met a few awesome people the first day- 

- The Soccer Dude (a.k.a Arjun Pandey): An awesome dude and founder of **scoutsme**; and yeah he loves to code!
- The Einstien Visa Girl (a.k.a Harshita Arora): Another super-awesome dude('ess) and the creator of a super-cool cryptocurrency management application; and yeah she's a high school drop-out working in the Silicon Valley!
- The Haryanvi Dude (a.k.a Paritosh Dahiya): Well we already met at IRIS 2017 & he created a fingerprint analyzer for blocking children to enter adult sites!
- The Planet Dude (a.k.a Richard Joseph): The most amazing dude! More coming about him soon!

The prestigious award ceremony was conducted on the morning of 22nd January at The Rashtrapati Bhavan. Every awardee was allowed along with 2 escorts to the Darbar Hall where the medal was awarded by the Honorable President of India. In the evening, all the awardees were gathered for the briefing for the dress rehearsal to be scheduled on 23rd January.

On 23rd, we were taken to the Rajpath for the Republic Day parade rehearsals. In the afternoon and the extended evening, We were called up to meet and interact with the Minister of Women & Child Development – Smiti Irani – followed by a press conference where all the awardees were asked to share our success stories and the difficulties We faced in our journey.

24th was a rather prestigious day as we were presented with the opportunity to meet with Honorable Prime Minister – Shri Narendra Modi. All the awardees were fortunate enough to obtain a personal photograph along with a combined group picture. Then, our Prime Minister had an interactive session with us that followed up to the lunch. In the evening we were to be summoned for the Doordashan’s interview followed by Rajya Sabha TV’s interview.

On 25th, all awardees were taken out for Delhi Darshan; in the evening, we were called for Republic Day’s parade instructions. On the 26th of January, Republic Day, we all were summoned on open jeeps at the Rajpath early morning. We were presented with the prestigious opportunity to be a part of the parade till the India Gate. After the parade, all the awardees along with the escorts were called for the closing ceremony. The ceremony was lit up by the gracious words of few intellectual dignatories and filled with joy by the tremendous performances by some of the awardees. The event ended on 26th with a final group photograph along with a dispersal goodbye and best wishes for the future!
